Breast cancer is a term used to describe a group of diseases where cells in the breast tissue grow abnormally and spread in an uncontrolled way https://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/breast-cancer/introduction), 4(https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/basic_info/what-is-breast-cancer.htm), 5(https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/about/what-is-breast-cancer.html)]. There are various subtypes of breast cancer, and some factors like genetics and environment can influence a person's risk https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/3986-breast-cancer), 6(https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/breast-cancer)].

While this answer provides a high-level understanding, it's important to consult a medical professional for any questions or concerns regarding breast cancer.

Breast cancer detection involves a combination of self-exams, clinical exams by a doctor, and imaging tests [6(https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/screening-tests-and-early-detection.html)].

Imaging tests like mammograms and ultrasounds can help find abnormalities that may be cancerous, but a biopsy is the only definitive way to diagnose breast cancer [3(https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/screening-tests-and-early-detection.html), 4(https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20352475), 6(https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/basic_info/diagnosis.htm)]. Early detection is crucial for successful treatment outcomes [3(https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/screening-tests-and-early-detection.html)].
